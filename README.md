# ESP32-S3 Smart Home Control Panel

A feature-rich, touch-screen Smart Home Control Panel built for the **Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-4B**. This project integrates WiFi, MQTT (Home Assistant), Weather tracking, and Power Management into a sleek UI designed with SquareLine Studio and powered by LVGL.

**Please note:** some are work in progress **(WIP)**

## 🌟 Features

### 🏠 Smart Home Control (MQTT)

* **Grid Control:** 9 dedicated switch buttons for common devices (Light, Fan, AC, Plug, TV, Bed, Lock, Heater, All). **(WIP)**
* **Bi-Directional Sync:** Updates UI state based on incoming MQTT messages and publishes commands immediately on touch. **(WIP)**
* **Customizable Topics:** MQTT Host, Port, Credentials, and Notification topics are fully configurable via the on-device Settings menu. **(WIP)**

### 🌤️ Weather & Location

* **Auto-Location:** Automatically detects city and coordinates using `ip-api.com`.
* **Live Weather:** Fetches real-time weather data from `open-meteo.com` (No API Key required).
* **Dynamic UI:** Background images and weather icons change dynamically based on conditions (Rain, Snow, Clear, Clouds) and time of day (Day/Night).

### 🔔 Notification System

* **MQTT Alerts:** Receive text notifications directly from Home Assistant (via `ha/panel/notify`).
* **History Center:** Stores up to 15 recent notifications in a scrollable list.
* **Popup Actions:** Read details or delete individual alerts; "Clear All" functionality included.
* **Visual Indicators:** Home screen badge count for unread alerts.

### ⚙️ System & Connectivity

* **WiFi Manager:** On-screen WiFi scanning, password entry, and "Saved Networks" management (stores up to 5 networks).
* **Timekeeping:** Automatic NTP synchronization or Manual RTC (PCF85063) setting via keypad.
* **Persistence:** All settings (WiFi, MQTT, Device Name) are saved to Non-Volatile Storage (Preferences).

### 🔋 Power Management

* **Hardware Integration:** Full support for **AXP2101 PMU** to monitor battery percentage, voltage, and charging status.
* **Screensaver & Sleep:**
* *30 Seconds:* Dim screen/Show Screensaver (Clock & Weather).
* *60 Seconds:* Turn off backlight to save battery.  **(WIP)**
* *Wake:* Tap screen or shake device (IMU-based wake using QMI8658).

## 🚀 Setup Guide

1. **Clone the Repository:** Download the project files.
2. **UI Files:** Ensure the `sleepscreen` folder (generated by SquareLine Studio) is in the same directory as your `libraries` folder.
3. **Install Libraries:** Use the Arduino Library Manager and Manual library configuration to install the dependencies listed below.
4. **Install Boards:** Use the Arduino Boards Manager to install the dependencies listed below.
5. **Compile & Upload:** Connect the board via USB-C and upload using the settings provided.
6. **On-Device Setup:**
    * Upon first boot, go to **Settings > WiFi Setup**.
    * Scan and Connect to your WiFi.
    * Go to **Settings > Home Assistant**.
    * Enter your MQTT Broker IP, Port (usually 1883), User, and Password.
    * Save Settings.

### 📦 Library Installation

This project requires specific driver libraries provided by Waveshare to function correctly with the display, touch, and power management chips.

**Download Required Libraries:**
[ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-4B Demo (Zip)](https://files.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-4B/ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-4B-Demos.zip)

**Installation Steps:**

1. Download the ZIP file linked above.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Locate the `libraries` folder inside the unzipped directory.
4. Copy the contents of that `libraries` folder into your Arduino libraries directory (Usually `Documents/Arduino/libraries`).
    - *This installs: `Arduino_GFX`, `XPowersLib`, `SensorLib` (QMI8658/PCF85063), and `lvgl` configured for this board.*
5. **Additional Libraries:** If not included in the ZIP, install the following via the Arduino Library Manager:
    - `PubSubClient` by Nick O'Leary (v2.8)
    - `ArduinoJson` by Benoit Blanchon (v7.4.2)
6. **Boards:** Install the following via the Arduino Boards Manager:
    - `Arduino ESP32 Boards` by Arduino (v2.0.18-arduino.5)
    - `esp32` by Espressif Systems (v3.3.6)

### Arduino IDE Board Settings

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Board** | ESP32S3 Dev Module |
| **Port** | COMx / /dev/ttyUSBx |
| **USB CDC On Boot** | **Enabled** (Required for Serial) |
| **CPU Frequency** | 240MHz (WiFi) |
| **Core Debug Level** | None / Info |
| **Erase All Flash** | Disabled |
| **Events Run On** | Core 1 |
| **Flash Mode** | QIO 80MHz |
| **Flash Size** | 16MB (128Mb) |
| **JTAG Adapter** | Disabled |
| **Arduino Runs On** | Core 1 |
| **Partition Scheme** | **Custom** *Defined by partitions.csv* |
| **PSRAM** | **OPI PSRAM** (Crucial for 480x480 Display) |
| **Upload Speed** | 921600 |

### 💾 Partitions Configuration (`partitions.csv`)

Due to the large size of the GUI assets, the default ESP32 partition scheme is insufficient. Created partition file to allocate 10MB for the application, ensuring enough space for LVGL images.


### 🔗 MQTT Configuration (Home Assistant)

To integrate this panel with Home Assistant, add the following configuration to your `configuration.yaml` (or create Helpers) corresponding to the topics defined in the code.

**Payloads:** `ON` / `OFF`

| Switch Name | Command Topic (Set) | State Topic (Listen) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **LIGHT** | `ha/panel/light/set` | `ha/panel/light/state` |
| **FAN** | `ha/panel/fan/set` | `ha/panel/fan/state` |
| **AC** | `ha/panel/ac/set` | `ha/panel/ac/state` |
| **PLUG** | `ha/panel/plug/set` | `ha/panel/plug/state` |
| **TV** | `ha/panel/tv/set` | `ha/panel/tv/state` |
| **BED** | `ha/panel/bed/set` | `ha/panel/bed/state` |
| **LOCK** | `ha/panel/lock/set` | `ha/panel/lock/state` |
| **HEAT** | `ha/panel/heat/set` | `ha/panel/heat/state` |
